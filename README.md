# ANRO portal role descriptions


The ANRO portal is a new upcoming project designed to support and improve the recruitment, propaganda showcase and ANRO members experience. It is almost finished but I need some help with some roles descriptions, requirements and awarded points.

Every commit and contribution to this website is highly appreciated. If you can help with improving or adding at least one role description or requirement, please do not hesitate to do so.
