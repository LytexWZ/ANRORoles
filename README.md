# ANRO portal role descriptions


The ANRO portal is a new upcoming project designed to support and improve the recruitment, propaganda showcase and ANRO members experience. It is almost finished but I need some help with some roles descriptions, requirements and awarded points.

Every commit and contribution to this website is highly appreciated. If you can help with improving or adding at least one role description or requirement, please do not hesitate to do so.


## How can I contribte? 

Open a pull request and add a description / requirement to any of the roles listed in data.js

The only fields you should modify are rhe following:

description (brief description of the role) 

requirements (what do you need in roder to obtain the role) 

points (how much points you need in order to get the role or in case of certifications or awards, how much points they award)

## Examples
### Before
```
"Administration Director": {
        description: "",
        requirements: "",
        points: "N/A",
        category: "departments"
    },
```
### After
```
"Administration Director": {
        description: "Oversees all administrative operations and strategic planning for ANRO",
        requirements: "",
        points: "N/A",
        category: "departments"
    },
```
